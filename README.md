# icecreamy-themey-theme
Help a snarky robot try out ice cream flavors. Works like a theme switcher.

Hi hi we used CSS to style a set of interactive cards with buttons that switch the theme using JS. The idea is that you're helping a robot taste flavors!! Complete with snarky flavor text.




# (from my project submission)


# Challenges I ran into
Changing properties of the cards themselves was something I found to be much more complicated than I expected once I got to it. I had to settle for changing colors alone, even though I was hoping to go nuts with the borders, fonts, and other text features to **really** sell that vibe of visually expressing a taste.

# What's next for Ice Creamy Themey Themes!
If I can, I'm thinking to rewrite blocks of code to make it much easier to change some aesthetic features of the website. I'd like each different flavor to have it's own personality, not just a color palette. I wasn't able to change any aspects of the individual cards on the fly besides the colors, and I ended up feeling a bit underwhelmed. But with some restructuring, I bet I can make it work.
