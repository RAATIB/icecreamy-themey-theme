        <h1> Greetings. I am gustationBot44. They call me the flavor chameleon.</h1>
        <h2> I ingest those compositions of material which you humans deem "food."
            In doing so, my composition changes to express the material in a visual format.
            <br>
            The last thing I tasted was coffee. Almost fried my circuits, and the previous team didn't even reset me. Anyways, today's trial is ice cream flavors.
            So pick a card, any card.</h2>
            <h3> Seriously. I don't care which one. I'm a system of inputs and outputs. My emotions are predetermined.
                I mean, so are yours, but your kind doesn't really like existential thought, does it? It gives you, what do you call it? Ah, yes the "heebie-jeebies."

    <div class = "vanilla-flavor-text">
        <h1>Objective Conclusion</h1>
        <h2>Oh! Creamy. Sweet. It's... well, it's ice cream. So basic that it's a synonym for "default" in some contexts and "not kinky" in... others.
            <br>
            This flavor has got a place in benchmarking whether your ice cream is decent, or if the ingredients are so screwy it has to be called a "frozen dairy dessert" by law. Have you heard about that? Eh, you can google it.
            Anyways, vanilla is lowkey underrated. Respect for the great equalizer.</h2>

    <div class = "strawberry-flavor-text">
        <h1>Objective Conclusion</h1>
        <h2>Hm... old school. I feel like the people who get this flavor
            only exist in cartoons or are in their sixties. I'm built to look into that claim, but sometimes it's more fun to let it simmer.
            Not sure who lets me get away with that.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are so many great flavors of ice cream! And then there's this one. I mean, no judgment. I am a humble machine. Beep boop.
            But also, like, just get fro-yo, y'know?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I know what you're thinking. Only two flavors? Yeah, I get it. I'm getting bored.
            Go yell at my creator. Apparently he was "busy" because of "finals."
            <br>
            <br>
            He said he was gonna figure out the fonts, the border, the whole shabang if he had the time. Yeah, right. He's probably just playing TFT.
